# Monte_Carlo_Julia
Implemented the Monte Carlo method to produce an approximation of Pi. 
In my program, I excersized the fact that I could use Emojis! 
So, I basically redefined the value of a unicorn to pi. Hoorah!

Oh, and I also create a visual simulation (.gif) or what is happening during the Monte Carlo method.

Basically, I wanted to test out Julia and see what it had to offer. 

Enjoy this simple little program!
